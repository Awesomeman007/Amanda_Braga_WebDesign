            Amanda is a Brazilian fashion designer based in Miami. From an early age she was interested in the arts and manual tasks and her favorite activity was always drawing, which she loves to do until the present days. For Amanda, few things are more pleasurable than seeing an idea become material and enter people's lives, creating bonds between those who create and those who wear it.

            <h2> Design is her language </h2>
            <p>
                It's her way of being in the world. She is fascinated by the beauty of colors and its combinations, the mixture of geometric and organic shapes, different materials with its textures and finishes.
            </p>
            <p>
                She has always been curious and loves to see and explore the world, learn other languages and cultures. Traveling is one of the things she enjoys the most, not only to relax, but also to learn and research. When younger, she moved to Germany to study design at <a href=""> Hochschule für Gestaltung Offenbach am Main </a> and then to Portugal to specialize in Fashion Design at <a href=""> Universidade do Minho </a>, an opportunity that helped her to improve her knowledge on developing a fashion collection and creating a new product.
            </p>
            <p>
            Back to Brazil, she founded <a href=""> Trocando em Miúdos</a>, a brand that has become a reference in accessories design and creative economy in Brazil. The brand gathered fans for more than a decade and its works were featured in several international medias and magazines such as Vogue Brasil, Marie Claire, among others.
            </p>
            <p>
            Since 2018 Amanda has been living in Miami, USA, a new experience that is helping her to expand her cultural horizons. Her values for a design process are shaped by building products with beauty, quality, meaning and purpose.

            <h2 id="projects" class="sliding"> Jewelry design </h2>
            <p> 
                Since she was a child, beautiful things caught the attention of Amanda. Her mother is an architect and also passionate about the arts, which became a huge reference for Amanda. She always was impressed by her mom's jewelry and Amanda's favourite was a graduation ring made by a brazilian jewelry designer Clementina Duarte.

            <p>
                Later, Amanda had the opportunity to experience working at Clementina's studio and fell in love with the jewelry universe. The jewelry production process impressed her. It begins from hand drawing, to technical drawing, with various angles of the piece, up to the execution by the goldsmith. For Amanda, execution is the magic part of the process - taking the project of the paper and making it real, it is a dynamic, living action.
            </p> <br>
            <p>
                Years later, she now has the opportunity to bring back those memories by immersing herself in the world of jewelry, always looking to improve and learn new techniques.

            <h2 class="sliding"> Creative consulting & Product design </h2>
            <p>
                Carrying 13 years of experience as a designer, creative and production director at the fashion accessories company Trocando em Miúdos, Amanda developed a creative consultancy focused on fashion products. This consultancy helps brands and its team to create together fashion collections and new products. This work consists of creating the concept of a special collection or line, researching and systematizing inspiration panels, color palettes, aesthetic parties, choosing materials and researching competing and/or similar products.
            </p> <br> <br> <br>
            <p>
                In addition to the creative consultancy work, the collection can also be developed – technical drawings and specifications for production – based on the research raised by the creative consultancy or from a briefing or research that the brand has previously built.
